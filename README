Pmac-Passim
--------------
Pmac-Passim is actually two separate programs which go together: a simple virtual machine interpreter 
for a stack-based processor (Pmac), and an assembler for the Pmac instruction set (Passim). They should be compiled 
and run separately, with Passim used to assemble sample programs, and Pmac used to interpret them.
