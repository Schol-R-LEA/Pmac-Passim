Pmac README file
-----------------
Pmac is a pseudo-machine (or virtual machine) simulator for a hypothetical stack machine. It is designed primarily as
a simple target for assemblers and compilers, allowing the client programmers to write their programs with limited
concern for the details of the target machine. The simulator consists of a single C program file, pmac.c .
